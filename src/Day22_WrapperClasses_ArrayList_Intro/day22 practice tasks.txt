1. Write a program that can retrieve the letters, digits and special characters from the string
        Ex:
            str = "Wooden Spoon!"

        output:
            letters= "WoodenSpoon";
            Digits = "";
            specialChars = " !";

2. Write program that returns true if the total number of upper case characters are equal to total number of Lowercase characters of a string
        Ex:
            str = "JAVA java";

        output:
            true

3. write a program that can combine two String arrays into one arrayList
                ex: 
                    arr1 = {"A", "B", "C"};
                    arr2 = {"D", "E", "F", "G"};
                    list ==> {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"}


4. Write a program that can find the maximum & minimum numbers from an ArrayList of integers
        Ex:
            list = [1,2,3,4,5];

            output:
                Maximum number is 5
                Minimum number is 1
