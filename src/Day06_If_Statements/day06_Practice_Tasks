1. Create a class named MedianNumber. write a program that can find the median number between three DIFFERENT given integers

		Ex:
                a = 10, b= 15, c = 20;

            Output:
                15 is the median number

2. Create a class named NumberToWord, and write a java program that can convert numbers between 0 ~ 9 to words
			Ex:
				number = 1;

			output:
				One

		Note: Do not use more than one print statement

3. Create a class called Calculator, Given two double variables named n1 & n2, and a char variable named mathOperator, write a program that can calculate result of n1&n2 based on the given math Operator.

		char operator -> -, +, *, /

		when operator is + : add num1, num2
		when operator: - : minus num1, num2
		when operator: * : multiply num1, num2
		when operator: / : divide num1, num2
		for any other operators: print "invalid operator"

		Ex:
			n1 = 10, n2= 20, mathOperator = '+'

		output:
			30

4. Create a class named CharacterIdentity, and write a program that can identify if the given character is a digit or Alphabetic Character(A~Z or a~Z) or a special character

		Ex:
			ch = '@'
			output:
				Special Character

			ch = '1'
			output:
				digit

5. Create a class named EqualNumbers, and write a program that can check the equality of the three given numberrs
	 			declare 3 numbers n1, n2, n3
	 			if all are equal ==> print "all equal"
	  			if only n1 and n2 are equal  =>print  "n1&n2 are equal"
	   			if only n2 and n3 are equal ==>print "n2&n3 are equal"
	   			if only n3 and n1 are qual ==>print "n3&n1 are equal"
				if none of them are euqal ==> none of them are equal

6. Create a class named NetIncomeCalc, Write a program that can calculate the salary after tax based on the following requirements
                the tax rates are:
                        35% for salary of 130K or more
                        30% for salary of 100K to 129k
                        25% for salary of 80K to 99K
                        20% for salary of 79K or less

                in addition, if the person is married, he/she will pay 5% less tax
